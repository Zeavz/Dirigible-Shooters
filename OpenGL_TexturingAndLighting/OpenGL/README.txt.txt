This assignment I put into a sample code the proffessor provided us, and suggested integrating our projects inside it as SOIL was included already
so opening the soultion file and running should start it all right up.

controls

arrow keys to move and go up and down   => the dirigible will already have a foward acceleration and move forward on its own
q => accelerate
e => decelerate
w => periscope up
s => periscope down
d => periscope mode toggle
space => shoot
h => help
i => to go into "walk through terrain" mode purpose is to get most out of periscope mode as the periscope view from higher up is essentially empty cause dirigible 
	isnt allowed to go below the height of the highest mountain, to get out can just keep moving up or press down arrow key as itd trigger the boundary code

the hills are generated through a textfile those values can be changed, located in /bin/info.txt
